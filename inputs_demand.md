GCAM's demand inputs include information on consumption and prices in the historical period in order to calibrate model parameters. Additional parameters related to income and price elasticities are needed for modeling future periods. GCAM requires demand data to be globally consistent with [supply data](inputs_supply.html) for each of its historical model periods as it solves for market equilibrium in these years as it does for future years. These inputs are required for each [region](common_assumptions.html#regional-resolution) and [historical year](common_assumptions.html#historical-years).

TODO: This page currently only includes text copied from AgLU. Much more work needs to be done.

## Raw Inputs

### Description

#### Food, Feed, and Forestry

<dl>
<dt>Historical Consumption</dt> <dd>Inputs include food, non-food, bioenergy, and feed consumption of all crop and forestry products for each of the 32 geopolitical regions for the historical base years. We currently rely on IMAGE for animal feed and FAO data for all remaining inputs. Feed inputs also include secondary outputs of DDGS (dried distillers grains and solubles) from ethanol production, and feedcakes from biodiesel production.</dd>

<dt>Historical Prices</dt> <dd>Inputs include the price of all food, feed, and forestry commodities for our historical base years. We currently use producer prices from FAO for these inputs.</dd>

<dt>Price and Income Elasticities</dt> <dd>Elasticity parameters that influence the response of agricultural demand to future changes in prices and income levels.</dd>
