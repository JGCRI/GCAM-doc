PNNL is committed to making the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) a community tool â€“ expanding its user community and gradually opening the development of the model to this community. A range of users across the globe are now using and modifying GCAM for their individual research needs.&nbsp;This wiki is still a work in progress. We will continue to expand this page with detail as available. In the interim, please download the GCAM Tutorial presentation from the 2011 Community Modeling meeting ([7mb pdf](https://wiki.umd.edu/gcam/images/3/3c/GCAM_tutorial_2011.pdf)). In addition, we have included a list of model parameters ([GCAM Model Parameters](GCAM_Model_Parameters "wikilink")).

**Listserve:&nbsp;**To support the emerging community of GCAM users, we have created a GCAM Community Listserve. The listserve serves as a place for conversations among GCAM users and to ask . It also serves as a vehicle for raising questions about GCAM to which other members of the community or staff at the Joint Global Change Research Institute might respond. Finally, it serves as a means to make announcements about updates or changes to the model. To subscribe to the listserve with email, please send an email to&nbsp;<listserv@listserv.umd.edu>&nbsp;with the email body: subscribe gcam-community . You can also go directly to the website for the listserv, which has all the functionality including posting at:&nbsp;[<https://listserv.umd.edu/archives/gcam-community.html>](https://listserv.umd.edu/archives/gcam-community.html). You do not have to be registered to view the archive on the website.&lt;br&gt;

**Research with GCAM:&nbsp;**Individual researchers within and without PNNL are welcome to make any changes they like for their own research interests. &nbsp; &lt;blockquote&gt;

-   However, any revised version must be identified not as GCAM but as GCAM-xxxx. For example, the GCAM version that has been customized to India is referred to as GCAM-IIM (for India Institute of Management)

&lt;/blockquote&gt; Before attempting to run the model, please review the [minimum system requirements for GCAM](Minimum_system_requirements_for_GCAM "wikilink"). &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
