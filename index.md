title: Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM)
current-version: v4.2
---

The Joint Global Change Research Institute (JGCRI) is the home and
primary development institution for GCAM, an integrated assessment
tool for exploring consequences and responses to global
change. Climate change is a global issue that impacts all regions of
the world and all sectors of the global economy. Thus, any responses
to the threat of climate change, such as policies or international
agreements to limit greenhouse gas emissions, can have wide ranging
consequences throughout the energy system as well as on land use and
land cover. Integrated assessment models endeavor to represent all
world regions and all sectors of the economy in an economic framework
in order to explore interactions between sectors and understand the
potential ramifications of climate mitigation actions.

GCAM has been developed at PNNL for over 20 years and is now a freely
available community model and documented online (See below). The team
at JGCRI is comprised of economists, engineers, energy experts, forest
ecologists, agricultural scientists, and climate system scientists who
develop the model and apply it to a range of science and policy
questions and work closely with Earth system and ecosystem modelers to
integrate the human decision components of GCAM into their analyses.

## GCAM Model Overview
# Introduction

GCAM is a global integrated assessment model that represents the behavior of, and complex interactions between five systems: the energy system, water, agriculture and land use, the economy, and the climate. GCAM has been under development for over 30 years. Work began in 1980 with the work first documented in 1982 in working papers (Edmonds and Reilly, 1982a,b,c) and the first peer-reviewed publications in 1983 (Edmonds and Reilly, 1983a,b,c). A this point, the model was known as the Edmonds-Reilly (and subsequently the Edmonds-Reilly-Barnes) model. The model was renamed MiniCAM in the mid-1990s, and the model was renamed to GCAM in the mid-2000s. The first coupling to a carbon cycle model was published in Edmonds, et al. (1984). The first use of GCAM (MiniCAM at the time) in conjunction with a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis was published in Reilly, Edmonds, Gardner and Brenkert (1987).
Throughout its lifetime, GCAM has evolved in response to the need to address an expanding set of science and assessment questions. The original question that the model was developed to address was the magnitude of mid-21st-century global emissions of fossil fuel CO2. Over time GCAM has expanded its scope to include a wider set of energy producing, transforming, and using technologies, emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases, agriculture and land use, water supplies and demands, and physical Earth systems. It is increasingly being used in multi-model, multi-scale analysis, in which it is either soft- or hard-coupled to other models with different foci and often greater resolution in key sectors. For example, it has been coupled to a state of the art Earth system model (Collins, et al., 2015). GCAM has been used to produce scenarios for national and international assessments ranging from the very first IPCC scenarios (Response Strategies Working Group, 1990) through the present Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (Ebi, et al., 2014). Hundreds of papers have been published in peer-reviewed journals using GCAM over its lifetime and the GCAM system continues to be an important international tool for scientific inquiry. GCAM is also a community model being used by researchers across the globe, creating a shared global research enterprise. GCAM can be run on Windows, Linux, Apple, and high-performance computing systems.

# Background: Integrated Assessment Models

GCAM is an integrated assessment model. The role of integrated assessment research and integrated assessment modeling is to bring multiple human and physical Earth systems together in one place to shed light on system interactions and provide scientific insights that would not otherwise be available from the pursuit of traditional disciplinary scientific research alone. IA models are constructed to explore these interactions in a single computational platform with a sufficiently low computational requirement to allow for broad explorations of scenarios and uncertainties. IA models include both human and physical Earth systems, Figure 1. Components of an IA model are designed to capture the behavior of human and physical systems, but they do not necessarily include the most detailed process-scale representations of its constituent components. On the other hand, IA model components in principle provide a faithful representation of the best current scientific understanding of underlying behavior.

In general IAMs can be divided into two categories, those that are highly aggregated and whose core problem is the conduct of global, century-scale, cost-benefit analysis (examples include DICE, FUND, and PAGE), and higher resolution models whose core problem is understanding the physical and economic details of human and physical Earth system interactions. GCAM is a member of the latter class of more highly-resolved IA models.

IA models like GCAM, as with any model, are not predictors of the future. They are used to provide conditional forecasts of the future. GCAM takes in external “scenario assumptions” about key drivers such as population, economic activity, technology, and policies, analyzes the implications of these through representations of human and physical systems operate and interact, and then developed a more complete, modeled scenario description that includes the implications of the scenarios assumptions, for example, on commodity prices, energy use, land use, water use, emissions, and concentrations.

Conditional forecasts with a single set of scenario assumptions is the most common way that a model such as GCAM is used to explore scientific and assessment questions. However, another class of question that GCAM has taken up is the systematic representation of uncertainty. As early as the 1980s, GCAM was used to map the implications of uncertain key input assumptions and parameters into implied distributions of outputs such as greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, energy prices, and trade patterns. A range of techniques has been employed using GCAM to explore the potential range of future outcomes. Techniques include, scenarios analysis, sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations. Exploring and understanding the role of uncertainty in shaping events remains an important research use of GCAM.
