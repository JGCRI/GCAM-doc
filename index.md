title: Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM)
gcam-version: v4.3
---

The Joint Global Change Research Institute (JGCRI) is the home and
primary development institution for the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), a comprehensive integrated modeling tool for exploring energy, water, and land interactions over timescales of decades to a century.

GCAM and its predecessor models have been in use for over 35 years. GCAM is now a freely available community model and documented online (See below). The team
at JGCRI is comprised of economists, engineers, energy experts, forest
ecologists, agricultural scientists, and Earth system scientists who
develop the model and apply it to a range of science and policy
questions and work closely with Earth system and ecosystem modelers.

## GCAM Model Overview

### Introduction

GCAM is a global integrated model that represents the
behavior of, and complex interactions between, five systems: energy
, water, agriculture and land use, economy, and
climate. GCAM has been under development for over 30 years. Work began
in 1980 on the Edmonds-Reilly, and subsequently
Edmonds-Reilly-Barnes (ERB), model (Edmonds and Reilly 1982, 1983a,b, 1985). The model was renamed MiniCAM in the mid-1990s and GCAM in the mid-2000s, around which time the model was also re-written in an object-oriented C++ framework (Kim et al. 2006). The
first coupling to a carbon cycle model was published in Edmonds, et
al. (1984). The first use of GCAM (MiniCAM at the time) in conjunction
with a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis was published in Reilly et al. (1987).

Throughout its lifetime GCAM has evolved to address an expanding set of science and assessment questions. The
original question to which the model was applied was the
magnitude of mid-21st-century global emissions of fossil fuel
CO<sub>2</sub>. Over time GCAM has expanded its scope to include a wider set of
energy producing, transforming, and using technologies, emissions of
non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse and air pollutant gases, agriculture and land use, water supplies and demands, and physical Earth systems. It is increasingly being used in
multi-model, multi-scale analysis, in which it is either soft- or
hard-coupled to other models with different foci and often greater
resolution in key sectors. For example, it has been coupled to a state
of the art Earth system model (Collins, et al., 2015). GCAM has been
used to produce scenarios for national and international assessments
ranging from the very first IPCC scenarios through the present Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
(Ebi, et al., 2014, Calvin et al. 2017). Hundreds of papers have been published in
peer-reviewed journals using GCAM over its lifetime and GCAM
continues to be an important tool for scientific
inquiry. GCAM is also a community model being used by researchers
across the globe, creating a shared global research enterprise. GCAM
can be run on Windows, Linux, Apple, and high-performance computing
systems.

### Background: Integrated Modeling Tools

The role of integrated modeling tools such as GCAM is to bring
multiple human and physical Earth systems together to
shed light on system interactions and provide scientific insights that
would not otherwise be available from the pursuit of traditional
disciplinary scientific research alone. Such integrated assessment models (IAMs) are constructed to
explore these interactions in a single computational platform with a
sufficiently low computational requirement to allow for broad
explorations of scenarios and uncertainties. IA models include both
human and physical Earth systems, Figure 1. Components of an IA model
are designed to capture the behavior of human and physical systems,
but they do not necessarily include the most detailed process-scale
representations of its constituent components. On the other hand, IA
model components aim to provide a faithful representation of the
best current scientific understanding of underlying behavior.

In general IAMs can be divided into two categories: high-resolution and highly aggregated. GCAM is a higher resolution model which, by including economic and Earth system components, focuses on 
understanding physical and economic details of human and
Earth system interactions. A second type of IAM is more 
highly aggregated and focused on the conduct of global,
century-scale, cost-benefit analysis (examples include DICE, FUND, and
PAGE). GCAM does not contain the components necessary to conduct cost-benefit analysis.

Models such as GCAM do not provide predictions of the
future. They are used to provide conditional "forecasts" of the
future. GCAM takes in external scenario assumptions for key
drivers such as population, economic activity, technology costs, and
policies, and produces a model scenario that illustrates the
implications of the scenarios assumptions, for example, on commodity
prices, energy use, land use, water use, emissions, and
concentrations.

Conditional forecasts with a small set of scenario assumptions is the
most common way that a model such as GCAM is used to explore
scientific and assessment questions. However, another class of
question that GCAM has taken up is the systematic representation of
uncertainty. As early as the 1980s, GCAM was used to map the
implications of uncertain key input assumptions and parameters into
implied distributions of outputs such as greenhouse gas emissions,
energy use, energy prices, and trade patterns. A range of techniques
has been employed using GCAM to explore the potential range of future
outcomes including structured scenario analysis, sensitivity
analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations. Exploring and understanding the
role of uncertainty in shaping events remains an important research
use of GCAM.
