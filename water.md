In the last several years with the contribution of multiple GCAM modelers, we have included the representation of water demands from all end-uses and economic sectors. Water use representations have been constructed for six major categories: irrigated agriculture, electric power, industries, municipal, primary energy, and livestock. Both withdrawal and consumptive use of water are represented.  We have published several journal articles in investigating the implications of alternative water demands and also in conjunction with climate mitigation policies (Chaturvedi et al. 2013, Davies et al. 2013, Hejazi et al. 2013, 2014a, 2014b, Kyle et al. 2013).

## Water Demand
GCAM models demands for water from irrigated agriculture, electric power, industries, municipal, primary energy, and livestock.

### Irrigation


### Electric Power

Power plant cooling options are specifically modeled. Five cooling options are potentially available for each power technology: once-through, recirculating, cooling-pond, dry-cooling, and seawater. Not all options are necessarily available for each power plant technology. Alternative cooling options are logit-nested within each power plant technology that has cooling water requirements, and power plant energy outputs are calibrated by specific cooling types. The capital cost for cooling has been separated from the total power plant capital cost and conveniently located within the cooling technology representation/module. The logit share-weighting factors of different cooling technology options for future periods are modified in most regions from the calibrated historical values, reflecting our prior research on the likely evolution of cooling system types around the world (documented in Davies et al. 2013). In general, all regions are expected to move away from once-through cooling systems that use freshwater to recirculating systems for the most part. The additional level of nesting is achieved through the use of “pass-through” sector and technology, similar to the transportation sector representation of “passenger-road” service.
