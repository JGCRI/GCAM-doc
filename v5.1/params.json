  "body": "# Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM)\r\n\r\nThe Joint Global Change Research Institute (JGCRI) is the home and\r\nprimary development institution for GCAM, an integrated assessment\r\ntool for exploring consequences and responses to global\r\nchange. Climate change is a global issue that impacts all regions of\r\nthe world and all sectors of the global economy. Thus, any responses\r\nto the threat of climate change, such as policies or international\r\nagreements to limit greenhouse gas emissions, can have wide ranging\r\nconsequences throughout the energy system as well as on land use and\r\nland cover. Integrated assessment models endeavor to represent all\r\nworld regions and all sectors of the economy in an economic framework\r\nin order to explore interactions between sectors and understand the\r\npotential ramifications of climate mitigation actions.\r\n\r\nGCAM has been developed at PNNL for over 20 years and is now a freely\r\navailable community model and documented online (See below). The team\r\nat JGCRI is comprised of economists, engineers, energy experts, forest\r\necologists, agricultural scientists, and climate system scientists who\r\ndevelop the model and apply it to a range of science and policy\r\nquestions and work closely with Earth system and ecosystem modelers to\r\nintegrate the human decision components of GCAM into their analyses.\r\n\r\n## Model Overview\r\n\r\nGCAM is a dynamic-recursive model with technology-rich representations\r\nof the economy, energy sector, land use and water linked to a climate\r\nmodel that can be used to explore climate change mitigation policies\r\nincluding carbon taxes, carbon trading, regulations and accelerated\r\ndeployment of energy technology. Regional population and labor\r\nproductivity growth assumptions drive the energy and land-use systems\r\nemploying numerous technology options to produce, transform, and\r\nprovide energy services as well as to produce agriculture and forest\r\nproducts, and to determine land use and land cover. Using a run period\r\nextending from 1990 – 2100 at 5 year intervals, GCAM has been used to\r\nexplore the potential role of emerging energy supply technologies and\r\nthe greenhouse gas consequences of specific policy measures or energy\r\ntechnology adoption including; CO2 capture and storage, bioenergy,\r\nhydrogen systems, nuclear energy, renewable energy technology, and\r\nenergy use technology in buildings, industry and the transportation\r\nsectors. GCAM is an Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)-class\r\nmodel. This means it can be used to simulate scenarios, policies, and\r\nemission targets from various sources including the Intergovernmental\r\nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC). Output includes projections of future\r\nenergy supply and demand and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions,\r\nradiative forcing and climate effects of 16 greenhouse gases, aerosols\r\nand short-lived species at 0.5×0.5 degree resolution, contingent on\r\nassumptions about future population, economy, technology, and climate\r\nmitigation policy.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n* [GCAM Documentation](http://wiki.umd.edu/gcam/index.php?title=Main_Page)\r\n* [Getting Started with GCAM](http://wiki.umd.edu/gcam/index.php?title=Getting_Started_with_GCAM)\r\n* [GCAM Community](http://www.globalchange.umd.edu/models/gcam/gcam-community/)\r\n* [2015 Tutorial Slides](http://www.globalchange.umd.edu/data/annual-meetings/2015/GCAM_Tutorial_2015.pdf)\r\n* GCAM lectures from the UMD Water and Climate class\r\n\r\n  * [Lecture 3: Introduction to GCAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRF9lFwtMr0)\r\n  * [Lecture 4: GCAM Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vAShH-dbs)\r\n\r\n## Selected Publications\r\n\r\nEdmonds, J., and J.
