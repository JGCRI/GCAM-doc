<dt>Other emissions</dt> <dd>Outputs include emissions of
CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, NH<sub>3</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO,
BC, OC, and NO<sub>x</sub>. Greenhouse gas emissions are produced from
livestock, rice, and fertilizer application; these emissions can be
reduced with the application of a carbon price. Pollutant emissions
are produced from agricultural waste burning, forest fires,
deforestation, and savannah burning. Livestock emissions are
calculated annually at the 32 region level. All other emissions are
